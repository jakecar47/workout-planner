perf.txt lists the statements you used to create indexes.
It also include the queries that were affected by the indexes.
Under each query, provide time consumption before and after adding the index. 
This should be done after populating the database with data.

1.
SELECT id, name, target_muscle, description, image_path
FROM exercises
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE ?
ORDER BY name ASC;

We chose this query because it goes through every single row in our biggest table, and is used constantly
as it it used whenever a user looks up a exercise, which is quite often.

We used the index: CREATE INDEX idx_exercises_name ON exercises(name);

Consumption before: 0.06266100 = 62.66 ms
Consumption after: 0.05134425 = 51.34 ms
Time saved: 0.01131675 = 11.31 ms

2. 
SELECT we.workout_id, we.exercise_id, e.name AS exercise_name, we.time, we.sets, we.reps
FROM workout_exercises we
JOIN exercises e ON we.exercise_id = e.id
WHERE we.workout_id = 51
ORDER BY e.name ASC;

We chose this query because it is used whenever you look at a specific workout, which for a user logging
workouts is very often

We used the index: CREATE INDEX indx_workout_exercises_workoutid on workout_exercises(workout_id) 

Consumption before: 0.01158025 = 11.58 ms
Consumption after:  0.0028615 = 2.85 ms
Time saved: 0.00871876 = 8.71 ms
