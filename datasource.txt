This is the link to the datasource: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hemandas/exercise-animation-gif/data

This datasource contained a complete dataset of around 1318 exercises, most of them with working gifs,
the target muscle, and a description of the exercise.

To implement it, we first downloaded it, but it didn't fit our schema, so we went through, in excel, and deleted
and rearranged the rows. Then, we moved the file into uploads/exercises and used an absolute path to pull from the 
datasource. After struggling with changing the absolute path across partners, we moved the dataset into 
src\main\...\resources\datasets, and designed a DataLoader using Apache Commons CSV to parse the information, and
use a sql statement to insert the parsed information into the exercises table.
