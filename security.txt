The approach that we used to store passwords is the same exact approach that was used in Project 2. 
We used the BCrypt password hashing algorithm, which generates a random salt and does an expensive one-way hash function.
This ensures that if two users choose the same password, the stored password hashes will still be different.
During registration, BCrypt hashes the password and stores the hash in the database.
During login, we use the matches() function, which hashes the supplied password and compares it to the stored hash.
This ensures that common password-theft techniques do not work and the passwords cannot be reversed or recovered from the stored data.
